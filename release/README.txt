Silent install:   Waraq_x_y_z_x64-setup.exe /S            (optional: /D=C:\path, last argument, no quotes)
Silent uninstall: "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Waraq\uninstall.exe" /S
The installer offers "Open with Waraq" for .pdf (never takes over the default), owns .waraq, and adds a right-click
"Open in Waraq" entry for both; all per-user registry keys are removed on uninstall (src-tauri/installer/hooks.nsh).
Not code-signed (owner declined a certificate, 2026-10): SmartScreen shows "unknown publisher" on first run.
